# WebViewWithAVPlayerPOC
This is POC of AVPlayer using WebKit. Just provide the video link, Media player loads in Web view and plays the video. Here's important thing to keep in mind, the video link must be the embedded URL of video. The best part of of the web view is, you can watch video while app is in background or while using another app.<br />
